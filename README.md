# MEAN Contact List
## It's really mean...

### Project Details
Simple contact list application using MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.JS.

Controller actions: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

MongoJS has been used in place of Mongoose for tracking database.


### To be completed
- Non sh*thouse bootstrap styling.
- Bug fix needed: updating a contact and pressing adds new contact linked to the same user_id.
- Mandatory fields before adding a new contact.
- Test adding a new page and moving RESTFUL controller actions into new 'required' file in server.js

### Time for a frosty!
